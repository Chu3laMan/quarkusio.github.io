We released Quarkus 3.14.3, a maintenance release for our 3.14 release train.

It contains several important bugfixes so we recommend the upgrade for anyone already using 3.14.

While our maintenance releases usually don't include new features, we made an exception here as the SBOM generation was frequently requested
and people wanted it in 3.15 LTS.

Given part of the Quarkus dependencies are build time dependencies not present in the runtime classpath,
some work was needed for SBOM generation to provide the complete picture of the Quarkus application dependencies.

You can find more information about SBOM generation in the https://quarkus.io/guides/cyclonedx[dedicated guide].
If you experiment with it, feedback is highly welcome!

With Quarkus 3.14.3, also comes Quarkus 3.15.0.CR1 which is based on the same code.
Quarkus 3.15.0 core artifacts will be released next week for everyone to prepare the Platform and extensions.
Quarkus 3.15.0 LTS release is planned for September 25th.
