Imagine you are working on a Zulip chatbot or GitHub integration or some other Quarkus application that uses webhooks to call into your application. How do you test that locally?

You need to somehow expose your local service to the internet so that the webhook can be (pun intended) hooked in. There are various options out there like ultrahook, localtunnel, and ngrok.

In this post, we will look at ngrok and how you can use it with Quarkus.

https://ngrok.com[ngrok] is a local running agent that via a cloud service allows you to expose your local services to the internet.
