    - title: "Observability.Next"
      board-url: "https://github.com/orgs/quarkusio/projects/42"
      short-description: Observability.Next is a strategic initiative to modernize the observability stack within the Quarkus framework, aiming to streamline and enhance its ability to monitor and manage distributed systems.
      readme: |
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Observability.Next is a strategic initiative to modernize the observability stack within the Quarkus framework, aiming to streamline and enhance its ability to monitor and manage distributed systems. Currently, Quarkus (3.16.x) leverages the following components for observability:
        Metrics: Managed through <a href="https://micrometer.io/">Micrometer</a>, which supports multiple registries (e.g., Prometheus) to expose application metrics.
        Tracing: Handled via the OpenTelemetry (OTEL) SDK, enabling distributed tracing data to be exported to an OTEL collector.
        Logging: JBoss's LogManager with a handler forwarding logs with OTEL.</p>
        <p>While OpenTelemetry is the industry standard for observability, both in protocol and format, the OTEL SDK has proven challenging to adapt due to its design for agent-based observability. In a framework like Quarkus, more granular and direct control over observability is required to monitor application performance, reliability, and user experience effectively.</p>
        <p>Micrometer, the de-facto Java standard for metrics, has recently proposed an enhanced, global approach to observability with the new Observation API. Expanding Micrometer’s role in Quarkus’ observability stack represents an opportunity to simplify implementation and maintenance while preserving compatibility with leading observability tools.</p>
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>The Observability.Next initiative seeks to strengthen the integration of Micrometer’s evolving Observability API within Quarkus, aligning it with OpenTelemetry’s protocol standards. Key objectives include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Enhanced Observability Control: Implement a framework-native, Micrometer-centric approach to metrics, traces, and logs, ensuring developers have more refined control over observability components without the limitations of the OTEL SDK.</li>
        <li>Broader Metrics and Tracing Compatibility: Continue exposing metrics to various registries, including Prometheus, while maintaining OTEL compatibility for metrics and tracing protocols.
        Improved Performance and Reliability: Define and measure performance baselines of the current observability setup and compare them against the next-to-be Micrometer Observation API and OTEL bridge integration to ensure tangible performance and reliability improvements.
        Continue to support components using Micrometer metrics API or Open * Telemetry SDK (like Pulsar)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Observability.Next will unfold across multiple phases, each handled by specialised working groups. The scope of the initial working group will include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Micrometer Observation API Integration: Introduce and integrate Micrometer’s observability API as a foundational layer</li>
        <li>Transformation to OTEL Protocols: Develop a mechanism to translate Micrometer-collected observations into OTEL-compatible metrics, traces, and logs, ensuring smooth interoperability with OTEL-based tools and collectors.</li>
        <li>Performance Benchmarking: Establish a performance baseline for Quarkus’ current observability model, comparing it against the new Micrometer-based observability API and OTEL bridge to quantify gains and identify areas for further optimisation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
        <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li>Improved Developer Experience: More intuitive, refined control over observability for Quarkus developers, reducing complexity and overhead associated with setting up and maintaining observability.</li>
        <li>Ecosystem Compatibility: Continued compatibility with existing observability tools such as Prometheus and OTEL collectors, ensuring interoperability with common enterprise monitoring solutions.</li>
        <li>Less breakage due to the OTEL SDK</li>
        <li>More control over the semantic convention in span and metric tags</li>
        <li>Performance Gains: Potentially lower latency and resource consumption in observability operations, contributing to Quarkus’ goal of high-performance, cloud-native applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some concrete features we would get at the framework level:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Instrument once, plug different frameworks later</li>
        <li>Better support of scopes than the one we have today. See:
        https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/25102 and
        https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/37140</li>
        <li>Auto-generate metrics documentation from source code instrumented with it.</li>
        <li>A way to manage semantic conventions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users would benefit from:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A way to manage their metrics schemas.</li>
        <li>Yet a new framework is available if they want to use it.</li>

    - title: "Test classloading"
      board-url: "https://github.com/orgs/quarkusio/projects/30"
      short-description: The goal of this working group is to rewrite Quarkus's test classloading, so that tests are run in the same classloader as the application under tests, and Quarkus extensions can do "Quarkus-y" manipulations of test classes.
      readme: |
        <p>At the moment, Quarkus tests are invoked using one classloader, and then executed in a different classloader. This mostly works well, but means some use cases don't work: extensions cannot manipulate test classes in the same way that they do normal application classes. For example, anything run via a JUnit @TestTemplate test case will see the un-transformed class.</p>
        <p>It also means we have extra user-facing complexity, such as the QuarkusTest*Callbacks](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing#enrichment-via-quarkustestcallback):</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>While it is possible to use JUnit Jupiter callback interfaces like BeforeEachCallback, you might run into classloading issues because Quarkus has to run tests in a custom classloader which JUnit is not aware of.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>A final benefit is a reduction in the internal complexity of our code. Hopping between classloaders during test execution takes a lot of work, and adds a lot of code! It also is brittle in places. For example, because the hop between classloaders relies on serialization in some cases, it's becoming harder to do as the JVM tightens up security restrictions. We used to rely on xstream, but that stopped working in Java 17. In https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/40601, @dmlloyd moved us to use the JBoss Serializer, which works better, but might still be affected by future restrictions on class access.</p>
        <p>The goal of this working group is to allow test classes to fully participate in the 'quarkification' of classes. The mechanism for this is probably just to load the test classes with the classloader we intend to run them with, so that JUnit sees the 'correct' version of the class.</p>

      short-description: Allow Static Site Generation with Quarkus.
      readme: |
        <p>New initiative to allow Static Site Generation with Quarkus.</p>
        <p>Quarkus already provides most of the pieces to create great web applications (https://quarkus.io/guides/web).</p>
        <p>I recently added https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-roq. It will allow generating a static website out of any Quarkus application (it starts the app, fetch all the configured pages and assets, generate a static website and stop), it already works but it is still very alpha.</p>
        <p>What's missing? we now need to incrementally add the toolkit to ease the process of creating static content through Quarkus:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Static Data</li>
        <li>Markdown/Asciidoc and frontmatter</li>
        <li>SEO</li>
        <li>Image processing</li>
        <li>Easy to configure routing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This will allow to develop the content using Quarkus dev-mode, and then generate for Github Pages or similar when it's ready.</p>
        <p>Bonus, everything added will benefit any &quot;non-static&quot; Quarkus app and any Static Quarkus app could also become non static.</p>
        <p>This effort is now tracked using a &quot;Working Group&quot; project: https://github.com/orgs/quarkiverse/projects/6</p>
        <p>This is a great opportunity to participate in fun effort and be involved with the Quarkus community, if anyone is interested in being a part of this, please reach out to me 🚀</p>

      short-description: Track the progress around the new TLS configuration centralization and new features (like Let's Encrypt, Cert-Manager, and local experience...)
      readme: |
        <p>TLS is becoming increasingly common and recommended. However, for years, each Quarkus extension has been doing its own TLS configuration and management. As a result, the configuration looks different everywhere, and many extensions have incomplete configurations.</p>
        <p>Based on the newly integrated TLS registry, we now have a single place to configure TLS. At runtime, it provides methods to configure Vert.x and &quot;pure&quot; Java clients (using an <code>SSLContext</code>).</p>
        <p>The goal of this focus group is to continue integrating the TLS registry and improve Quarkus integration with certificate providers (Let's Encrypt, Cert-Manager). In addition, we would like to provide a frictionless local experience around TLS (i.e., without the infamous untrusted certificate screen).</p>

      short-description: A working group focusing on the generation of Dockerfile / ContainerFile
      readme: |
        <p>At the moment, when you create a Quarkus project (from code.quarkus.io or the CLI), a set of <code>Dockerfiles</code> is generated. However,</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Not all these files are used by the user</li>
        <li>These files are very quickly outdated</li>
        <li>It does not allow <em>extensions</em> to customize the content</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This working group aims to replace these `Dockerfiles' with a CLI command that generates an up-to-date Dockerfile and includes extension customization.</p>
        <p>The goal is not to allow updating these files once generated but to provide a one-off generation that the user can consult and use. It will use the recommended and up-to-date <code>FROM</code> image to improve security and, depending on the generated <em>variant</em> (JVM, native, native-micro...), follow good practices (such as using <code>run-java</code> for the JVM one).</p>
        <p>You can find more details about this working group on <a href="https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/discussions/41352">this discussion</a>.
        Once completed, this working group will be followed by other initiatives focusing on generating the Github Action and Tekton pipelines.</p>

    - title: "Quarkus to the CommonHaus Foundation"
      board-url: "https://github.com/orgs/quarkusio/projects/38"
      short-description: Work needed around moving Quarkus to foundation and streamline open governance.
      readme: |
        <p>from Discussion at https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/discussions/43013</p>
        <p>We started the move of Quarkus to a foundation <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-in-a-foundation/">earlier this year</a> and recently <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-moving-to-commonhaus/">set the direction</a> towards <a href="https://www.commonhaus.org/">CommonHaus</a> and during the summer break the CommonHaus council <a href="https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation/pull/183">approved our request</a> to join.</p>
        <p>Thus, now the real work starts, and it's just fitting we set up a working group for the effort getting Quarkus to CommonHaus foundation.</p>
        <h1>Goal</h1>
        <p>Two parts</p>
        <ul>
        <li>setup Quarkus to have transparent and open governance</li>
        <li>Go through the few but important requirements for a CommonHaus project.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Initial work items/questions:</h1>
        <p>Current known list, but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>identify design communication channels (i.e. #41973)</li>
        <li>which repositories / code will move</li>
        <li>impact (if any) on quarkiverse projects</li>
        <li>how will trademarks work/change</li>
        <li>identify running services and setup/maintain them (registry.quarkus.io, code.quarkus.io etc.)</li>
        <li>add required metadata/files to the various repositories</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Tracking</h1>
        <p>We will use the working group board to track publicly all the known relevant work and questions.For the few exception cases where, for legal or personal constraints, the work must happen in private, we will post the outcome and results in public places (like a GitHub discussion of a GitHub issue tracked on the working group board).</p>
        <h1>When will this working group be done?</h1>
        <p>When Quarkus has an active working governance model in place and all major work items around setting up Quarkus at CommonHaus are completed - after that, its expected things will just be iteratively improved, and the dedicated working group will not be needed (others might start to continue more specific efforts).</p>
        <p>The majority of the work must be done before the end of December 2024. The latest deadline for CommonHaus is April 2025, when the bootstrap period of CommonHaus ends.</p>

        Started working on full list of repos and infrastructure that needs clarifying. Can't share it publically yet due to red hat infrastructure details but will soon share.
        
        Marking as risk as deadline april 1st is looming and still things to define. 
        
        There is a Quarkus f2f meeting next week that could clarify/move things forward and start to share more publically as things get moved over from internal IT.
